Design and implement a TwoSum class. It should support the following operations: add and find.

add - Add the number to an internal data structure.
find - Find if there exists any pair of numbers which sum is equal to the value.

For example,

Add(1); 
Add(3); 
Add(5);
Find(4) -> true
Find(7) -> false
